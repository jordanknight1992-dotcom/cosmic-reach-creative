# Cosmic Reach Creative

Production website for Cosmic Reach Creative. Built with Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind CSS 4, and TypeScript. Statically generated and deployed on Vercel.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In Vercel, import the repository.
3. Framework preset: **Next.js** (auto-detected).
4. No environment variables required. Domain is configured in `src/config/site.ts`.
5. Deploy.

If the domain `cosmicreachcreative.com` is already connected to the Vercel project, the new deployment will replace the existing site automatically.

## Site Config

All site-wide configuration lives in one file:

```
src/config/site.ts
```

This includes:
- Site name, canonical domain, contact email
- Calendly booking URLs (Signal Check and Clarity Session)
- GA4 measurement ID
- Navigation items
- Hidden routes (not shown in nav but publicly accessible)

Update this file to change any global setting. All CTAs, metadata, and links read from this config.

## How Markdown Mapping Works

Page content is stored directly in each route file under `src/app/*/page.tsx`. The content strings follow a custom markdown format parsed by `src/lib/markdown-parser.ts`:

| Syntax | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `# Title` | Hero section title (first H1) |
| `---` | Section divider |
| `IMAGE: filename.jpg` | Renders image from `/public/images/` |
| `ICON: name` | Renders SVG icon from `/public/icons/` |
| `[CTA: Label]` | Renders a CTA button |
| `[Primary CTA: Label]` | Primary styled CTA |
| `[Secondary CTA: Label]` | Secondary styled CTA |
| `CTA: Label` | Bare CTA (also works) |
| `**Title** - description` | Framework card (when 2+ appear in a section) |
| `- item` | Bullet list |

### Icon Alias Map

The file `src/lib/icon-alias.ts` maps markdown icon names to the 10 actual SVG icons in the payload. If a referenced icon name doesn't exist, it falls back to `spark`. See the file for the full alias table.

## Design System

Design tokens from `design-tokens.json` are converted to CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and mapped into Tailwind's `@theme` directive.

- **Fonts**: Space Grotesk (headings), Inter variable (body). Loaded locally from `/public/fonts/`.
- **Colors**: Deep Space, Navy, Starlight, Copper, Spark Red.
- **Spacing**: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64/96/128 scale.
- **Motion**: 150/250/450ms with ease-out curve. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Assets

All assets come from the payload ZIP and live in `/public/`:

```
public/
  images/          # Hero and section images
  images/founder/  # Founder photo
  icons/           # 10 SVG icons
  fonts/           # Space Grotesk + Inter woff2
  favicon/         # Favicon set
  logo/            # Logo variants (SVG + PNG)
```
